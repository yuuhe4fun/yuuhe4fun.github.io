# Research Experience

## 2022
### *First-principles prediction of the half-metallicity in quaternary Heusler CoRhCrAl thin films*
**Supervisor:** Prof. [Ping Kwan Johnny Wong](https://teacher.nwpu.edu.cn/pkjwong)
**Date:** Oct. 2020 ~ June 2021

In this research, a first‑principles study of the structural, electronic and magnetic properties of the pristine bulk CoRhCrAl quaternary Heusler alloy and its (111),
(001) and (110)‑oriented thin films were performed by using VASP based on the density functional theory.

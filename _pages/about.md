Current
======
*I'm looking for a PhD position in the field of computer security and cryptography.*

Short Bio
======
I am **Shen WANG (何煜)**, a third-year undergraduate student at the [School of Cybersecurity](https://wlkjaqxy.nwpu.edu.cn/), [Northwestern Polytechnical University (NWPU)](https://www.nwpu.edu.cn/), majoring in Information Security. I grew up in Fuyang, Anhui in northern China.

Education

The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header.

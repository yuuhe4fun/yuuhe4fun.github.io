excerpt: 'Recently, there has been a surge of research in the field of superconducting spintronics, which combines superconductivity and magnetism. This emerging field is considered an alternative or complementary approach to traditional complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology, offering high efficiency and effectiveness. Furthermore, the unique physical phenomena resulting from the interplay of these two competing properties have attracted increasing attention for their potential application in low-power quantum computing. In this review, we focus on the latest advancements in spin-related superconducting logic devices, specifically categorized as superconducting diodes based on their semiconductor counterparts. Additionally, given the ultralow operating temperatures required for these devices, we provide a comprehensive overview of compatible cryogenic memory technologies that incorporate spin-related principles. Finally, we address the key challenges currently hindering the practical implementation of spin-related superconducting electronics and offer insights and directions for future research in this field.'
